The pose client (here the monolithic visAR program) will connect to the pose server (the Kalman filter) over TCP to a configurable host and port.

The pose server will send one line per update, each terminated with \r\n (CR-LF). Updates are expected to be transmitted at 1000 Hz.

Each line's contents will be of a serialized JSON object, consisting at least of:
    
    position_ecef: an object containing of x, y, and z numbers giving the position of the point of reference as an ECEF point
    orientation_ecef: an object consisting of w, x, y, and z numbers giving the orientation of the local coordinate system of the point of reference as a quaternion that transforms points from the local coordinate system to the ECEF coordinate system
    velocity_ecef: an object containing of x, y, and z numbers giving the velocity of the point of reference as an ECEF vector
    angular_velocity_ecef: an object containing of x, y, and z numbers giving the angular velocity of the point of reference's local coordinate system as an ECEF vector

The point of reference is currently defined as the point directly between the user's two pupils. The local coordinate system has +X being forward, +Y being towards the left eye, and +Z being towards the forehead.


Example:
    
    {"position_ecef": {"x":738575.65, "y":-5498374.10, "z":3136355.42}, "orientation_ecef": {"x": 0.50155109,  "y": 0.03353513,  "z": 0.05767266, "w": 0.86255189}, "velocity_ecef": {"x": -0.06585217, "y": 0.49024074, "z": 0.8690958}, "angular_velocity_ecef": {"x": 0.11570315, "y": -0.86135956, "z": 0.4946438}}<CR><LF>
    <another JSON object><CR><LF>
    <another JSON object><CR><LF>
    <...>

This is someone standing near MIL at 0 altitude, facing directly east, moving directly north at exactly 1 m/s, and turning directly left at exactly 1 radian/s.
