libVisar
========


Contains everything you've ever wanted in a Python augmented reality package.

# Features
- Map
- Terrain simulation


# Consideration
- Should be able to bench-test with a simulator (i.e. change pose source, change view source)
- Should be able to bench-test with AND without oculus rift distortion
- It should be easy to add simulated input
