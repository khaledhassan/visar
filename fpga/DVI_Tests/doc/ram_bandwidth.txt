RAM bandwidth budget

Total: 12.8e9 bit/s

Write:
Cameras (peak, assuming one is reading out at a time): (500e6*4/10/3*32)/12.8e9 = 17%

Read:
Precacher commands (average): (136.5e6/1138/1933)*(1280*1024*2)/32*32/12.8e9 = 1%
Image data (average): (136.5e6/1138/1933)*(1280*1024*2)*(32/3)/12.8e9 = 13%
Distortion map: 136.5e6*(5*32)/33/12.8e9 = 5%
Ethernet (max): 1e9/12.8e9 = 8%
