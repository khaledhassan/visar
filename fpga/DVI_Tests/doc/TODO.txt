naive way of representing distortion map in RAM is very large - would make delaying it in FPGA impossible and reading it twice exceeds RAM bandwidth
    .: need to implement some sort of compression before anything else can happen

do we care about chromatic abburation right now? sure

let's start by not storing errors

(x, y) is (12, 11) bits if images are stacked sideways

every 2^n+1 pixels need (12+11)*6 bits
