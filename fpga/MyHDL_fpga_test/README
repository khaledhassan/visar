After installing the Xilinx ISE, you should put something like

  . /opt/Xilinx/14.3/ISE_DS/settings64.sh

in your ~/.bash_aliases file to put the toolchain programs on your PATH.
Otherwise, you have to run that command on every new shell you want to do
development in.


BUILDING

It's simply

  $ make program

which will try to build the bitstream and program the device if it succeeds.


DEVELOPING

* If a new source file is added, a reference to it has to be added to
  main.prj.
* If the toplevel entity changes or is renamed, the TOPLEVEL variable in
  Makefile needs to be changed.
